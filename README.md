# Sorja Thinking Remnants, bits, etc

We had to close our previous website when we were getting acquired. It's okay, though. We're now legally able to show some images of our previous website (if we can find it) along with some direct answers to some of the questions a lot of people around us having been asking.

### So, who are you guys and what lead to making this start up?

We are five practically brothers who've known each other since birth, and we were wild in all aspects: especially fanatics in solving a problem more efficiently. During out internship in the summer of 2019 at a place in the Big Apple, we realized that we could make risk projections more accurate with some "machinery." With the money we had, we then decided to focus on this making this a reality to help people with their investments. Each of us pooled in capital, and in August, we launched Sorja Thinking. 

### Why is this website here?

For nostalgia's sake and to answer some questions. We had a great run in a span of less than a year, and we felt great spending a lot of time with each other via dinner meetings, coding sessions, more meetings, etc- something we haven't done in ages.

### What's with the name SORJA?

It's an acronym of the first letters of our names.


### We saw you guys develop this in such a short time. How did that happen? Also, why did you guys act like you couldn't tell us about the company?

Well, for the first question, we don't know. We're grateful that the eggs landed in the basket somehow. According the "Big One," we threw crap at the wall, but all of it stuck.

We signed NDA's and the institution acquiring us made us sign NDA's as well, so there's not a lot we can openly tell. When this part comes up in small talk, it's kind of frustrating.

### Who bought you guys?

A Fortune 500 company. Can't say more.

### Was the old website closed when the third agreement was signed?

Yes, unfortunately.

### Okay, so why the NDAs?

We didn't want much attention or info leaking out. Or else, our value could have decreased by having competitors at large. Also, large corporations have an ego, so they usually want to hide that they bought a start up for their stuff so that they could say "we developed this thing."

### Did you guys hire anyone? If so, where are they now? 

We hired people, obviously, for our respective "office" locations. A few are now at other large corporations, and a few are being assimilated by the company that acquired us. 

### What about the newsletter? Can people still sign up?

For those currently subscribed (it should be just family, former clients, and certain investors), you'll still get it once every month or so. But, it'll be more of a personal update of the five of us. As there is a shift of focus, we are not going to accept any new "subscribers."

### What's next?

It was our last commercial venture as the five of us. Four of us might start a small investment firm. Our little one wants to pursue physics, sadly. But, we'll try to wheel him back to get the gang of five again.
