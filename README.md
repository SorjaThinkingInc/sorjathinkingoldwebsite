# Sorja Thinking Old Website

We had to close our previous website when we were getting acquired. It's okay, though. We're now able to host some parts through this repository to cherish our memories of our beginning.

## What's our story?

We are five practically brothers who've known each other since birth, and we were wild in all aspects: especially fanatics in solving a problem more efficiently. During out internship in the summer of 2019 at a place in the Big Apple, we realized that we could make risk projections more accurate with some "machinery."
